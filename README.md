# sql-challenge

This challenge involved creating a database for a fictional company called Pewlett Hackard. As a newly hired data engineer, I was given the task to create this database for a research project of employees who were employed between 1980 and 1990 using 6 CSV files. The data in these files were imported into the Postgres database to access the data using pgAdmin.

I sketched an Entity Relationship Diagram of the employees using QuickDBD, which is an online app that I used to create this diagram. I was also able to make a schema in QuickDBD of the 6 CSV files, which I later created as tables in Postgres. I developed queries to extract data from these tables based on the requirements for this assignment. 

The task involved data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis that are all components in manipulating and managing information. Data is powerful, so it is beneficial to know these topics to understand and solve business problems.
