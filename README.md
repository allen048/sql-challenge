# sql-challenge

This challenge involved creating a database for a fictional company called Pewlett Hackard. As a newly hired data engineer, I was given the task to create this database for a research projecct for employees who were employed between 1980 and 1990 using 6 CSV files. The data in these files were imported into the Postgres database to access the data using pgAdmin.
